Zero Glass – AI Smart Glasses Concept

Zero Glass aims to explore how AI-powered wearable technology can enhance human interaction with the real world in a natural and accessible way.


Overview

Zero Glass is a concept project for AI-powered smart glasses designed to help people interact with the world more easily and intuitively. This repository is created to present the idea, MVP, pitch deck, and prototype video in a simple and clear way, especially for potential partners such as AI companies, researchers, and technology organizations.

> ⚠️ Note: Zero Glass is currently a concept & early-stage MVP, not a finished commercial product.
